## Background

- I've decided to migrate my Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS single page portfolio into a React SPA.
- I was able to gain a lot of proficiency with React during my recent work experiences.
- So, I was inspired to build my portfolio with React Hooks :smile:
- While building this, I put a lot of effort in making the components reusable, so they can potentially be used in other projects.
- I used various open source libraries to enhance the visual effects of my portfolio.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
