## Background

-   I've decided to migrate my Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS single page portfolio into a React SPA.
-   I was able to gain a lot of proficiency with React during my recent work experiences.
-   So, I was inspired to build my portfolio with React Hooks :smile:
-   While building this, I put a lot of effort in making the components reusable, so they can potentially be used in other projects.
-   I used various open source libraries to enhance the visual effects of my portfolio.
